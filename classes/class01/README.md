## Questions (with Answers) from the "[Welcome to 500 Survey](http://bit.ly/500-2021-welcome-survey)"

If you haven't taken the survey already, please [do so today](http://bit.ly/500-2021-welcome-survey).

1. How much overlap of course material is there between 432 and 500?Â 
    - There isn't much overlap, really. The 500 course is more about designing observational studies than it is about statistical methods. There's a lot of R coding to make that happen, of course, and we'll use a lot of the tools we'll be developing in 432, particularly logistic regression, but we'll use them in a simpler and more straightforward way in 500 than in 432.
2. Is there anything we need to know about the in-person portion of the class at the end of the semester?
    - I had originally hoped there would be an in-person portion of the class, primarily I'd been thinking that perhaps we could have the project presentation sessions in person. That's not going to happen now, since not everyone will be vaccinated by the end of the class.
