## Logistics and Reminders

1. You should have received an email from me in the last 3-4 days with the subject heading "**PQHS / CRSP 500: Start of the Semester - Welcome!**" 
    - If you have this email, please attend to what it asks you to do. 
    - If you don't have this email, please let me know that via email to Thomas dot Love at case dot edu now.
2. If you haven't taken the Welcome to 500 survey already, please [do so today](http://bit.ly/500-2021-welcome-survey).
    - You must log into Google through your CWRU account to take the survey.
3. [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/README.md) is due next Thursday 2021-02-11 at 8 AM.
    - To do this Lab, you'll need to have [R and RStudio up and running for you](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/software_install.html), and [download the data from our Data site](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/data_index.html).
    - I encourage those of you less familiar with R to look at both [the R-basics materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/r-basics) I've provided, as well as the ["Lab 0" example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/lab0/README.md).
4. Please read the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2021-syllabus/) and familiarize yourself with the [Course Website](https://thomaselove.github.io/500), the Shared Google Drive (which you can see from your Google CWRU account), and [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) before next Thursday's class so that if you have any questions or problems getting started, we can settle them quickly.
    - Questions should be posted to 500-help at case dot edu, where our TA (Wyatt Bensken) and I will see them. Wyatt is also available for office hours by appointment.
5. The final word on all deadlines is the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html). All deliverables for the entire semester are listed.
6. I want to remind you of the University's resources to help you that are listed in [Section 8 of our syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2021-syllabus/university-resources-for-student-support.html), especially the newly available [CWRU Care 24/7 Mental Telehealth for Students](https://timely.md/faq/cwrucare/) program.


## Questions (with Answers) from the "[Welcome to 500 Survey](http://bit.ly/500-2021-welcome-survey)"

If you haven't taken the survey already, please [do so today](http://bit.ly/500-2021-welcome-survey).

1. How much overlap of course material is there between 432 and 500?Â 
    - There isn't much overlap, really. The 500 course is more about designing observational studies than it is about statistical methods. There's a lot of R coding to make that happen, of course, and we'll use a lot of the tools we'll be developing in 432, particularly logistic regression, but we'll use them in a simpler and more straightforward way in 500 than in 432.
2. Is there anything we need to know about the in-person portion of the class at the end of the semester?
    - I had originally hoped there would be an in-person portion of the class, primarily I'd been thinking that perhaps we could have the project presentation sessions in person. That's not going to happen now, since not everyone will be vaccinated by the end of the class.
