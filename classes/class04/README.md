## Pre-Recorded Lecture Materials

- The [toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2021) is the focus of today's pre-recorded lecture.

## Announcements

1. Wyatt has reviewed [the Lab 2 responses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab2). Overall, they were fairly solid, and I hope the sketch (posted to our Shared Google Drive) is of some help to you. Wyatt's main reminder is to look at your outcome of interest early on (before splitting the data) and removing any missing cases of the outcome. In this course, when actually doing an observational study of a treatment's effect on an outcome, we will not impute outcomes or treatments and instead remove cases with missing values in those key variables. We will impute missing covariates all the time.
2. A reminder that [your Observational Studies in Action claim](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/osia) is due 2021-03-02 at 9 PM. Several claims are already posted, and thanks to those of you who've completed that task.
3. A reminder that the [Project Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/project/01_proposal.md) is due to Canvas by 9 PM on 2021-03-09.
4. [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs) (which should look more like something you can do after reviewing the toy example) is due on 2021-03-11.

## Where is Dr. Love today?

- Meeting as part of the [Agency for Health Care Research and Quality's](https://www.ahrq.gov/) [Health Care Research Training Study Section](https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/process/study-section/hcrtrst.html).
    - This study section reviews applications requesting support for health services research training and career development at the dissertation, junior faculty, and senior faculty level. Research infrastructure applications are also reviewed in this study section and demonstrations and evaluations in topics spanning the entire spectrum of health services research, including but not limited to cost, quality, access, outcomes, quality and effectiveness research, and implementation and innovation research. 
    - The study section will review applications submitted through the auspices of the National Research Service Awards (NRSA) (institutional T32 awards, individual fellowship awards [such as F32 postdoctoral awards and other similar programs]); requesting support for dissertation research (R36), curriculum development, training models, innovations (R25 awards), individual and program career development awards (K series grants), mid-career training enhancement awards, healthcare-related IT training; and training-related conferences and workshops (R13).
