## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's class will be held from **9:30 AM to 10:50 AM**. Dr. Love will open Zoom 10 minutes before and stay on until we run out of questions after the main session.
- Before class, please watch the pre-recorded lecture using the link on our shared Google Drive, when it becomes available.
- The Slides for Class 06 are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class06/500_2021_slides06.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class06/500_2021_slides06.Rmd).
    - The pre-recorded lecture slides are the first 55 in the deck. 
    - The deck continues with additional material that we'll discuss in our class session.
- The Class 06 pre-recorded lecture focuses on what can be learned from Don Rubin's 2001 paper entitled [Using Propensity Scores to help Design Observational Studies: Application to the Tobacco Litigation](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/sources/articles/Rubin%202001%20Tobacco%20Litigation%20article.pdf).
    - Please skim or read [the Rubin 2001 paper](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/sources/articles/Rubin%202001%20Tobacco%20Litigation%20article.pdf) before you watch the Class 6 lecture.
    - We'll also be looking at the [Right Heart Catheterization example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc) in more detail, and this is the last of our R examples for this term.
- Next week's class (Class 07, on 2021-03-18) will be held from **9:30 - 11 AM**. 
- As always, Dr. Love will be available for the 10 minutes before and 15 minutes after this session for informal "office hours". If you need help with anything, please email us!
