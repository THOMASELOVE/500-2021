## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's class will be held from **9:30 AM to 10:45 AM**, with a pre-recorded lecture that you will find on our shared Google Drive that we expect you to watch prior to class.
- The Slides for Class 02 will be [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class02/500_2021_slides02.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class02/500_2021_slides02.Rmd).
    - The pre-recorded lecture slides are the first 72 in this deck. Watch the recording and review these slides before class.
    - The deck continues with additional material that we'll discuss in our class session.
- As always, Dr. Love will be available for the 10 minutes before and 15 minutes after this session for informal "office hours". If you need help with anything, please email us!
