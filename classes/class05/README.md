## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's class will be held from **9:30 AM to 10:45 AM**. Dr. Love will open Zoom 10 minutes before and stay on until we run out of questions after the main session.
- Before class, please watch the pre-recorded lecture using the link on our shared Google Drive, when it becomes available.
- The Slides for Class 05 will be [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class05/500_2021_slides05.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class05/500_2021_slides05.Rmd).
    - The pre-recorded lecture slides are the first XX in this deck. 
    - The deck continues with additional material that we'll discuss in our class session.
- As always, Dr. Love will be available for the 10 minutes before and 15 minutes after this session for informal "office hours". If you need help with anything, please email us!

## Announcements

1. Last Thursday, Wyatt and I updated [the toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2021) and [the lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) to deal with the changes caused by an update to the cobalt package, mostly. I assume you got my email - if not, please let us know.
