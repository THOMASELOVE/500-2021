## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's class will be held from **9:30 AM to 10:45 AM**. Dr. Love will open Zoom 10 minutes before and stay on until we run out of questions after the main session.
- Before class, please watch the pre-recorded lecture using the link on our shared Google Drive, when it becomes available.
- The Slides for Class 05 are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class05/500_2021_slides05.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class05/500_2021_slides05.Rmd).
    - The pre-recorded lecture slides are the first 41 in this deck. 
    - The deck continues with additional material that we'll discuss in our class session.
- The [dm2200 example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) demonstrates the use of several R packages to develop causal effect estimates using various types of propensity score matching. This example is a part of today's pre-recorded material, but I'm hopeful you'll be able to dip into it on your own as you need code to accomplish various types of propensity matching.
- As always, Dr. Love will be available for the 10 minutes before and 15 minutes after this session for informal "office hours". If you need help with anything, please email us!

## Announcements

1. On 2021-02-25, Wyatt and I updated [the toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2021) and [the lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) to deal with the changes caused by an update to the cobalt package, mostly. I assume you got my email - if not, please let us know.
2. On 2021-02-26, I posted to the Shared Google Drive my comments on Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment* including comments on all chapters other than the ones where you'll be writing [essays](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/essays/README.md), starting with the Chapter 7 essay due on 2021-03-18. 
3. On 2021-02-26, Dr. Love updated the [dm2200 example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) which is the focus of some of today's pre-recorded lecture.
