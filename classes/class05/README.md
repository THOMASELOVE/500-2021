## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's class will be held from **9:30 AM to 10:50 AM**. Dr. Love will open Zoom 10 minutes before and stay on until we run out of questions after the main session.
- Before class, please watch the pre-recorded lecture using the link on our shared Google Drive, when it becomes available.
- The Slides for Class 05 are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class05/500_2021_slides05.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class05/500_2021_slides05.Rmd).
    - The pre-recorded lecture slides are the first 41 in this deck. 
    - The deck continues with additional material that we'll discuss in our class session.
- The [dm2200 example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) demonstrates the use of several R packages to develop causal effect estimates using various types of propensity score matching. This example is a part of today's pre-recorded material, but I'm hopeful you'll be able to dip into it on your own as you need code to accomplish various types of propensity matching.
    - Noah Greifer's [MatchIt: Getting Started](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/vignettes/MatchIt.html) vignette
    - Noah Greifer's [Covariate Balance Tables and Plots: A Guide to the cobalt Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cobalt/vignettes/cobalt.html) vignette
    - Jasjeet Sekhon's [Multivariate and Propensity Score Matching Software for Causal Inference](http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/matching/) describes the Matching package.
- As always, Dr. Love will be available for the 10 minutes before and 15 minutes after this session for informal "office hours". If you need help with anything, please email us!

## Announcements

1. Remember that your [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/project/01_proposal.md) is due on **Tuesday** 2021-03-09 at 9 PM.
2. On 2021-02-25, Wyatt and I updated [the toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2021) and [the lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) to deal with the changes caused by an update to the cobalt package, mostly. I assume you got my email - if not, please let us know.
3. On 2021-02-26, I posted to the Shared Google Drive my comments on Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment* including comments on all chapters other than the ones where you'll be writing [essays](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/essays/README.md), starting with the Chapter 7 essay due on 2021-03-18. 
4. On 2021-02-28, Dr. Love updated the [dm2200 example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) which is included in today's pre-recorded lecture.
5. Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington recently developed a 50 minute lecture (now on YouTube) entitled [Avoiding the Pitfalls of Selection Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSVg_DqPkNM) which may of some interest to you.
6. On 2021-03-24, Alison Hill will be speaking on [Making R Markdown work better for you](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/events/274520287) for the Cleveland R Users Group.
7. [The Climate Crisis: Addressing Impacts on Clinical Practice in the Great Lakes Region](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-climate-crisis-addressing-impacts-on-clinical-practice-great-lakes-tickets-138287576865) is a half-day symposium on 2021-03-10 (8 AM to noon) targeting health care professionals, clinicians of all types, students and trainees. From the registration page, "this unique conference will educate and inspire health professionals and students about the health impacts of climate change. The symposium will not only educate participants but inspire motivation and provide the tools to develop solutions to counteract the health effects of climate change."
8. [RStudio has several internships available this summer](https://rstudio.com/about/job-posting/?gh_jid=4387673003). Not everyone is a good fit, but maybe you are?
9. I've placed a paper on our Shared Google Drive that I hope we'll discuss later in the semester. Here's the citation:

- Webster-Clark Michael et al. 2020 Using propensity scores to estimate effects of treatment initiation decisions: State of the science. *Statistics in Medicine*. 2020; 1â€“18. DOI: [10.1002/sim.8866](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8866)


## Next Week

For Class 06 on 2021-03-11, we will again start at 9:30 AM. 

- The Class 06 pre-recorded lecture will focus on what can be learned from Don Rubin's 2001 paper entitled [Using Propensity Scores to help Design Observational Studies: Application to the Tobacco Litigation](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/sources/articles/Rubin%202001%20Tobacco%20Litigation%20article.pdf).
    - Please skim or read [the Rubin 2001 paper](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/sources/articles/Rubin%202001%20Tobacco%20Litigation%20article.pdf) before you watch the Class 6 lecture.
    - We'll also be looking at the [Right Heart Catheterization example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc) in more detail, and this is the last of our R examples for this term.

## Making a Plan for OSIA

The schedule will be as follows:

- We will have **five** OSIA articles presented in Class 08 (2021-03-25), when we will run class from 8:30 AM to 11 AM.
    - Each presentation will involve a lead presenter (first reader) speaking for 12-15 minutes
    - This will be followed by a second reader speaking for 3-4 minutes
    - and then a little Q and A, so that we'll wind up with about 25 minutes per article
    - We will take a 10-minute break after the third OSIA is presented.
- We will have **three** OSIA articles presented in each of the next three classes (09, 10 and 11), when class will run from 9:30 AM to 11 PM.
    - I expect we will ask the first reviewers of most (if not all) of these nine articles to pre-record the primary (first reviewer) OSIA presentations. 
    - We will do all of the second reader presentations and have Q&A live.
