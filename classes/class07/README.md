## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's class will be held from **9:30 AM to 10:50 AM**. Dr. Love will open Zoom 10 minutes before and stay on until we run out of questions after the main session.
- Before class, please watch the pre-recorded lecture using the link on our shared Google Drive.
- The Slides for Class 07 are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class07/500_2021_slides07.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/classes/class07/500_2021_slides07.Rmd).
    - The pre-recorded lecture slides are the first 53 in this deck, and discuss sensitivity analyses for hidden bias. 
    - The deck continues with additional material that we'll discuss in our class session.
- As always, Dr. Love will be available for the 10 minutes before and 15 minutes after this session for informal "office hours". If you need help with anything, please email us!
