# OSIA (Observational Studies in Action)

This page houses information about **Observational Studies in Action** work for the course.

- For help with anything involved in the class, [contact us](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/contact.html).
- Deadlines for all assignments in 500 are provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html).

## The Schedule

Visit the [OSIA Schedule page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/osia/schedule.md) for links to all materials and complete details on who's presenting when.

## The Assignment

1. You will be responsible for presenting the methods and results of an observational study from the literature that uses propensity score methods.
2. You will also serve as "second reviewer" from one of the studies selected by your colleagues.

- The first step is to identify a study and claim it, as described below. The deadline for submitting your claim on a study is provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html). Dr. Love will then approve your study if it is appropriate, and if no one else has yet claimed it.

## What makes an appropriate study?

An appropriate study will 

- use (or at least primarily use) propensity score methods we will discuss in class (hence the need for Dr. Love's pre-approval)
- be a fully published manuscript, not a work in progress
- be published since 2010 in a venue where a PDF file of the study itself and any appendix materials can be shared with the class (so journals that are available to all CWRU affiliates are preferable). Dr. Love encourages you to look for studies published after 2015.
- **not** be one that you or your immediate supervisor have been involved in, and not be one that I have been involved in, in any capacity, and not be one that is included on our [Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/sources).

## Claiming a Study

Everyone will present a different study. To submit a study for approval, send a PDF of the study itself along with any appendix materials to Dr. Love in an **email** entitled "OSIA proposal" and include a brief (100 words is sufficient, in the body of your email) description of why this particular study is of interest to you. Please be sure to specify that you meet all of the standards listed above. The deadline for submitting your claim is found on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html), but we hope you will submit much earlier.

- If you select a study that is unsuitable, Dr. Love will let you know as soon as he can.
- If you select an acceptable study and you are the first to "claim" it, it's yours. Once a study is claimed, Dr. Love will post it on the claims page. If you select a study that someone else has beaten you to, you will have to submit an alternative.
- Once all students have successfully selected a study, Dr. Love will [schedule the presentations](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/osia/schedule.md) into the OSIA days listed in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html).

## Your Presentation as First Reader

You will give a 15-minute presentation (via Zoom) to the rest of the class summarizing the background, methods and key results of the study. 

- I suggest you plan on spending about half of the time discussing the statistical and design considerations.
- I strongly encourage you to provide useful graphs (created by you or by the original authors) to summarize key findings.

I encourage you to think hard about what might be most useful to us in this context. 

### Submission Details for the First Reviewer

For the study you have claimed, you will submit final versions of the slides for your class presentation (20 slides should be a reasonable maximum) to our **Shared Google Drive** (in the appropriate subfolder under the OSIA Presentations folder) by 3 PM on the day **before** your presentation, as indicated on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html) and on the [OSIA Schedule page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/osia/schedule.md). The file name should include your name, perhaps with the form YOURNAME_OSIA_rev1. Powerpoint, PDF or Google Slides documents are fine - if you want to use some other approach to develop slides, please ensure that we'll be able to view them through Google Drive. Please insert your OSIA presentation in the appropriate folder.

- This early submission will allow Dr. Love, the second reviewer of your article, and anyone else in the class to review your slides in advance, and will allow you to get a good night's sleep before your presentation.

## Second Reviewer

For each OSIA study, a "second reviewer" will be assigned once all studies are established (so that everyone does this job once.) 

- Second Reviewer Assignments are now posted to the [OSIA schedule page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/osia/schedule.md).
- The Second Reviewer for each study will provide 3-5 minutes of commentary on the study after the main reviewer's presentation. You are expected to present 2-4 slides as second reviewer. 

### Submission Details for the Second Reviewer

For the study on which you serve as second reviewer, you will submit the final version of your 2-4 slides for your presentation to our **Shared Google Drive** (in the appropriate subfolder under the OSIA Presentations folder) by 8 AM on the day of your presentation, as indicated on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html). We expect you to have reviewed the slides prepared by the principal reviewer (posted at 3 PM the day before) in preparing your materials.

## Audience Role

For each OSIA study, everyone will read the abstracts in advance, so that we can have some understanding of what's involved and contribute to the discussion. Key materials are already posted to the [OSIA Schedule page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/osia/schedule.md) and our Shared Google Drive will eventually contain all of the OSIA presentations.
