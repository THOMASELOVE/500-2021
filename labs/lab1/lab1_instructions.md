================

Last Update: 2021-01-26

## Submission Details

Submit your work via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by the deadline
specified in the [Course
Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html).

## 1. Get access to the DIG training data

Visit <https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/teaching/> and request copies of
the DIG “teaching” data set.

## 2. Build a mock proposal for a DIG observational study

Review the documentation available to you on the BIOLINCC page, and
complete a **mock proposal** not to exceed 300 words for an
observational study based on the available data from the DIG randomized
trial. A list of questions you should address follows below.

To help you build a response, you will find the following items
([above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab1))

-   a [PDF of the DIG data
    description](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/lab1/dig_documentation_with_supplement.pdf).
-   the [original 1997
    publication](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/lab1/dig_NEJM_1997.pdf)
    in the *New England Journal of Medicine* by the Digitalis
    Investigation Group.
-   a .csv file (`dig1.csv`) of [the DIG data
    set](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab1/data)
    you will obtain from NIH/BIOLINCC
    -   To download the .csv file, click on it, then click on Raw, and
        then download the result. Or just download the data from our
        [500-Data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data).

### Questions to be addressed in the Mock Proposals

1.  What comparison do you want to make? (Select a comparison different
    than the one made in the original DIG paper)
    -   Did patients receiving “EXPOSURE A” have lower rates of “BAD
        OUTCOME” than those who received “EXPOSURE B”?
2.  Why is this of interest?
    -   “OUTCOME” is important because …
    -   “EXPOSURE” (A or B) is important because …
    -   (*Be sure to clearly indicate what you hypothesize the effect of
        EXPOSURE on OUTCOME to be.*)
3.  What are the key measures - specifically, the exposure/treatment,
    the primary outcome, and important covariates that are available in
    the data to help address your question of interest?
    -   Exposure/Treatment = A or B, and be sure to specify the way in
        which you will know which exposure someone receives, and whether
        the exposure / treatment is applied using a randomized approach,
        or not.
    -   Outcome = …, and be sure to specify the variables you will use
        to determine the outcome, as well as the *type* of outcome, be
        it continuous, categorical (and if categorical, binary or
        multi-categorical) or survival (and if survival, is censoring
        involved?)
    -   Covariates of interest: We’d be interested in anything related
        to treatment choice or to outcome. You should provide a list of
        such variables of interest. Remember to include **ONLY** things
        which are measured prior to the exposure/treatment of interest,
        or which are not possibly changed by it.

Note that I’m **NOT** asking you to do any analyses in Question 2.

## 3. Build and evaluate a logistic regression model using DIG data

Use R, R Studio and R Markdown to execute a logistic regression model on
the `dig1.csv` data.

Your model should be fitted to a random training sample of 5,000
subjects (be sure to specify the seed you used to select that sample)
and then tested on the remaining 1,800 subjects, but you’ll probably
want to check for and deal with missingness in the entire sample before
splitting into training and test groups. *In this case, “dealing with
missingness” could be via imputation, as I’d like you to do in the rest
of this semester’s assignments, or by more simply developing a
complete-case analysis.* Your model will predict the probability that a
subject in the study will die (all causes), based on:

-   the subject’s assigned treatment (digoxin or placebo),
-   the subject’s age at randomization,
-   race,
-   sex,
-   ejection fraction (percent),
-   calculated body mass index,
-   NYHA functional class, and
-   whether or not the subject currently has angina.

The relevant variables in the `dig1.csv` data set are therefore:
`subjectid`, `DEATH`, `TRTMT`, `AGE`, `RACE`, `SEX`, `EJF_PER`, `BMI`,
`FUNCTCLS`, and `ANGINA`.
