# 500 "Lab 0" Example

"Lab 0" is a completely worked example, rather than an actual assignment. You are meant to read the instructions, and then review the data and answer sketch as a way of familiarizing yourself with what we're looking for in your later assignments.

- Start with the [instructions for Lab 0](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/lab0/lab0_instructions.md).
- The data for Lab 0 are in the `lab0.csv` file available on [the 500-data web page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data), and in the [data subfolder here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab0/data).
- An answer sketch for Lab 0 is available in both [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/lab0/lab0_sketch.Rmd) and [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/labs/lab0/lab0_sketch.pdf) formats. The R Markdown file is used to generate the PDF.
