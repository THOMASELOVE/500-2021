# Labs for 500 in Spring 2021

- Deadlines for all assignments in 500 (including the Labs) are found in [the Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/calendar.html).
- All Labs should be submitted [through Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
- For help on any Lab, contact us through `500-help at case dot edu` or attend TA office hours.

## Lab 0 - A Worked Example to get started

Before you work on your first Lab, you may need some orientation to what we're looking for. To help, we've created a ["Lab 0"](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab0) which provides a complete worked example for an old assignment from this course. Some of the ideas explored [in Lab 0](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab0) will be very helpful for later Labs, and [Lab 0](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab0) includes a complete answer sketch so you can try to replicate our work.

## Labs 1-5

Here are links to the lab assignments for Spring 2021.

- [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab1), which introduces the `dig1` data, used in Labs 1, 2, and 5
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab2), which involves some additional "warm up" analyses of the `dig1` data
- [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab3), which introduces the `canc3` data used in Labs 3 and 4, and involves several analyses based on the propensity score
- [Lab 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab4), which continues to analyze the `canc3` data, now using propensity weighting strategies
- [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/tree/master/labs/lab5), which returns to the `dig1` data to complete a propensity score analysis
