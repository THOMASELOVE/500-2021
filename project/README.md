# Course Project

As a substantial part of your course grade, you will complete a small observational study comparing two exposures on one or more outcome(s) in time to generate an abstract, give a presentation, and complete a thorough written discussion using R Markdown.

> It is hard to learn statistics (or anything else) passively; concurrent theory and application are essential.

- Though hardly an original idea in general, this particular phrasing is stolen from Harry Roberts, originally prepared for his courses at the University of Chicago. I am also grateful to Doug Zahn, for several helpful suggestions swiped from his work at Florida State University, and to Dave Hildebrand, for many things, not least his excellent example at Wharton. 

There is more to a statistical application than the analysis of a canned data set, even a good canned data set. George Box noted that "statistics has no reason for existence except as the catalyst for investigation and discovery." Expert clinical researchers and statisticians repeatedly emphasize how important it is that people be able to write well, present clearly, work to solve problems, and show initiative. This project assignment is designed to help you develop your abilities and have a memorable experience.

**Please don't be shy about asking for help sooner, rather than later. Options narrow as an investigation progresses. The earlier I hear about a problem, the more likely I will be able to help solve it.**

## Submission Specifications and Deadlines

- All deadlines related to the Project are provided on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/). 
- All materials for the project should be submitted through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), unless indicated otherwise by Dr. Love.

## Deliverables 

I want you to establish relevant and interesting research questions related to a problem of interest, procure data to help answer the questions and pose others, and communicate your results to an audience of your peers. You will be responsible for the following elements of a project. 

1. The [Project Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/project/01_proposal.md) for which you will submit an initial draft for my review, and then a final version with more details, according to the deadlines in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/500/). 

- Once you have your data, you will probably want to look at the [Tips for Analyzing your Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/project/analytic_tips.md) we've gathered.

2. The [Project Update](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/project/02_update.md) is the next step. Here you will be revising your proposal, verifying that you have the data and are proceeding appropriately. 

3. The [Final Materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2021/blob/master/project/03_final_materials.md). This includes:
    - An abstract
    - Your presentation slides
    - A data set, R Markdown file and HTML results document that shows all of your work to obtain the results in your slides, all of which are submitted after your presentation.
    - A discussion (as part of the HTML results document) of your results, also submitted after your presentation.
