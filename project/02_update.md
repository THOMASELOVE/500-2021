# Task 2: The Project Update

## Submission

The Project Update is to be submitted to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by the new deadline (March 31) specified in the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/calendar.md).

## Details

The update should include answers to the following questions. Parts 1 and 2 here should take at most one page. Part 3 is a revised version of the proposal you've already submitted, with some additional information, so of course, that's longer.

1. Describe the data - tell me what you have, and what you are still waiting for. 
    - Please provide a one (or more, if you need it) sentence data description statement that says something like the following...
        - I have the data, and I have imported it into R, and I have completed some recoding of variables and preliminary analyses.
    - Assuming the statement I have provided here is true, that's enough for me to see now. If you've done more than this, I don't need the details in this context.
    - If the statement here is not true because you haven't gotten to that point yet, please let me know as soon as possible. I'm going to want details on where you are and what the problem is, and I'm going to want those details as soon as possible, so I can make suggestions about what to do.

2. Describe the biggest problem you're currently having with regard to completing the design and analysis of the study. Feel free to describe multiple problems, especially if I can help. 
    - Write a paragraph (or more, if you need it) describing the major problems you're currently having. 
        - Or, if you have no major problems, tell me that, and describe the minor problems. 
        - Or, if you have no problems at all, tell me that, and tell me what you still plan to do.

3. How has your abstract changed from your approved project proposal?
    - Your update should include an edited version of the proposal you got approved initially, with additional materials and edits in reaction to my comments, and in reaction to changes that have occurred (i.e. I hope you will have details now on exactly how many observations you have, what the covariates are, etc.) This might now be as long as 4-5 pages, perhaps including a Table 1, but is basically just an edited version of what you've already submitted.  
        
You are welcome to include additional information in your update, but these three items are all I need.
